UNHM Programming Club Web App Design Document
=============================================

This Sphinx page can document the design for the web app. As of now, the technologies and functionality described in this document are only a proposal and are subject to change.

Ultimately, this documentation might contain:

 - Descriptions of technologies used
 - Links to references for those techs
 - Diagrams
 - Components Needed / Todo Lists
 - Descriptions of code created, processes used functionality.
 - Auto-documentation of code written, or links thereto
 - Rationales and alternatives

Design Goal
-----------
(Approved 7/10/2021)

"A technical news aggregator site geared towards programming and software development. The first MVP phase will be based on the Reddit API. It will identify top posts in dozens or more programming related subreddits which exceed the typical average for a top post and present the underlying articles to website visitors in a feed. Later iterations will have users/logins, comments, and scraping of other sources. The project will be monetized with Google Adwords ASAP to provide additional funding for the club."
