Contributing
============

Somewhat ironically, you can contribute by helping define the contribution policy. Most successful projects seem to utilize guidelines on how to contribute.

Here are some thoughts on code:

- Write tests first.

- Commit code in small chunks, not big re-writes.

- Comment code written with docstrings.

Contributing to this document in terms of ideas, commentary, editing, tutorials, and so forth might be as helpful as writing code.

There should be a list of contribution ideas - a todo list, in essence (Kanban type board?) - but other stuff could be welcome.

We should open a channel in the Discord for the web app
